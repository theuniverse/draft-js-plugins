  We need to limit the emoji width because it can be multiple characters
  long if it is a 32bit unicode. Since the proper width depends on the font and
  it's relationship between 0 and other characters it's not ideal. 1.85ch is not
  the best value, but hopefully a good enough approximation for most fonts.
